# Lesson 1 - Course Introduction

## Lesson Objective
I can properly connect my controller to Velocidrone and perform a controlled take-off, gentle hover, and landing using the four main controls in Acro mode.

## Velocidrone Setup

We will be using the **Velocidrone FPV Simulator** throughout this course. Velocidrone is one of the most popular and realistic FPV drone simulators, offering accurate physics and a wide variety of environments (tracks, freestyle areas, and open spaces) to practice your flying skills without the risk of crashing.

The official **[Velocidrone](https://www.velocidrone.com/)** website is blocked by USAFA WiFi. You must complete the account registration, purchase, and initial download/installation steps using a personal hotspot or non-Academy network.

1. Go to **[Velocidrone](https://www.velocidrone.com/)**. Register for a new account using a non-USAFA email address.
2. Navigate to the Shop section and purchase the main Velocidrone License.
3. Log in to your account and go to the My Licenses/Downloads section. Select the appropriate download for your operating system.

Allow the download and decompression process to finish completely. This can take a significant amount of time depending on your internet speed. When the main simulator application opens, you will be prompted to log in using the email and password you created on the website. This step assigns the license to your specific computer.

## Controller Connection

Before launching the simulator, you must connect your radio transmitter to your computer.

- Plug in the controller to your PC using a USB-C cable.
- Once connected, turn your radio on.
- Use the circular button on the left to select **'Joystick'** mode.

After launching Velocidrone, navigate to the **Controller Setup/Calibration** menu. The simulator will guide you through moving the sticks (Throttle, Yaw, Pitch, Roll) to set the correct ranges and center points. Feel free to assign switches on your radio (Aux channels) to the simulator's functions, typically for arming and starting a race.

## Controlled Take-off, Hover, and Landing

Ensure your simulator is set to **Acro Mode**. Acro is essential for learning FPV. It means the controller controls the rate of rotation (degrees per second), not the angle of the drone.

There are four primary controls, often referred to as the **Four Channels**. They control the direction and speed of the drone.

| Control (Stick Movement) | Channel Name | Drone Action | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Left Stick Vertical | Throttle | Controls vertical thrust. | The gas pedal in a car. |
| Left Stick Horizontal | **Yaw | Controls the rotation around the Z-axis. | Steering the car left/right. |
| Right Stick Vertical | Pitch | Controls forward/backward movement. | Tilting a shopping cart forward/backward. |
| Right Stick Horizontal | Roll | Controls left/right movement. | Tilting a plate to spill contents left/right. |

### Controlled Take-off

Your goal is to increase the throttle slowly and smoothly until the drone just leaves the ground and stops climbing.

* Very gradually increase the throttle input. Stop the stick input immediately once the drone is about 3 feet off the ground.
* The drone will likely start drifting. Use small, quick corrections with pitch (forward/back) and roll (left/right) to keep the drone stationary over its take-off spot.

### Gentle Hover

This is the hardest part. You must constantly adjust the four controls to maintain a fixed position.

* Constantly adjust the throttle slightly to fight gravity and keep the drone at the same height. If it climbs, reduce throttle; if it sinks, increase it.
* Use tiny, quick inputs on the right stick to stop any lateral movement. Think of it as **tapping** the stick, not holding it over.

### Controlled Landing

The goal is to set the drone down gently, not crash it.

* Keep the drone as steady as possible (using Pitch and Roll) while you decrease the throttle.
* Slowly pull the **Left Stick (Throttle) Down** until the drone is softly touching the ground.
* Once on the ground, pull the Throttle all the way down and hit your **Disarm Switch** (if set up). Throttle must be at 0% when you disarm.

## Lesson Review

* **Acro Mode** is the primary mode for FPV flying. It means the controller manages rotation rate, requiring continuous input to stay level.
* **Throttle** controls altitude and is the only non-centering control.
* Successful hovering is about **small, constant corrections**, not large, jerky movements.
