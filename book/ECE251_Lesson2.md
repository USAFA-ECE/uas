# Lesson 2 - Two-Axis Control

## Lesson Objective
I can achieve a stable hover, maintain a slow and gentle forward flight path, and execute controlled stopping and wide turns.

## Previous Lesson

| Control (Stick Movement) | Channel Name | Drone Action | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Left Stick Vertical | Throttle | Controls vertical thrust. | The gas pedal in a car. |
| Left Stick Horizontal | Yaw | Controls the rotation around the Z-axis. | Steering the car left/right. |
| Right Stick Vertical | Pitch | Controls forward/backward movement. | Tilting a shopping cart forward/backward. |
| Right Stick Horizontal | Roll | Controls left/right movement. | Tilting a plate to spill contents left/right. |

* **Throttle** controls altitude and is the only non-centering control.
* Successful hovering is about **small, constant corrections**, not large, jerky movements.

## Controlled Forward Flight

Forward movement is initiated by pushing the right stick forward (Pitch). This tilts the drone, converting some **vertical thrust into horizontal thrust**.

1. Achieve a stable hover about 3 feet off the ground.
2. **Gently push the right stick forward** (Pitch) to begin a slow forward drift.
3. Immediately bring the stick **back to center**. The drone will continue to move forward.
4. **Maintain altitude** with small Throttle adjustments.

Fly a **slow, straight line** across an open space. The focus is on a straight line and **consistent speed**, not on turning yet.

## Controlled Stopping

To stop the forward motion, you must tilt the drone backward (Pitch back) to counter the momentum. This is the reverse of the takeoff/acceleration process.

1. Fly forward slowly, as in the previous drill.
2. To stop, **gently pull** the Right Stick back (Pitch back) for a moment.
3. As the drone slows, **quickly re-center** the stick and transition immediately back to a **stable hover**.

Set up two visual markers (e.g., two posts). Start at the first marker, fly **slowly** toward the second, and stop **precisely** at the second marker, landing in a stable hover.

## Wide Turns

Turns in FPV are a **coordinated effort** of Pitch (forward momentum) and Roll (banking). Banking allows the drone to **lean** into the turn, much like a bicycle or airplane.

1. Start a slow forward flight path (using Pitch).
2. To initiate a turn (e.g., to the right), **gently apply Right Stick right** (Roll right) for a brief moment, then **center it**. The drone will bank and begin to arc.
3. To exit the turn, apply a **brief, small input** of Roll left to level the wings (counter-Roll), and continue the straight flight path.
4. **Never hold the Roll stick over.** Use **quick** inputs to initiate and terminate the bank angle

Using an open space, practice flying a large, wide figure-eight pattern. Focus on **smooth, sweeping turns** and **maintaining a constant altitude**. The turns should be wide and gentle, not sharp.

## Lesson Review

* Practice **Controlled Forward Flight**, **Controlled Stopping**, and **Wide Turns** in an open space using only Pitch and Roll.
* **Do not use Yaw.** We will introduce Yaw Control (The Left Stick Horizontal) on Lesson 3 to execute sharper, coordinated turns and fly through gates.
