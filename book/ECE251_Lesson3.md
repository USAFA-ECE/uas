# Lesson 3 - Coordinated Turns

## Lesson Objective
I can execute continuous, smooth circles and figure-eights by coordinating the Roll and Yaw controls.

## Previous Lesson

| Skill | What You Practiced | Key Idea |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stable Hover | Small, constant corrections | Stay calm and correct early. |
| Controlled Forward Flight | Pitch forward then re-center | Tap inputs, don’t hold them. |
| Controlled Stop | Pitch back briefly then re-center | Stop = counter momentum. |
| Wide Turns | Roll to bank, then counter-roll to level | Bank + forward speed = smooth arc. |

* Lesson 2 emphasized **Pitch + Roll** for gentle movement and wide turns.
* In Lesson 3, we add **Yaw** to point the nose where you want to go and make turns feel “connected” instead of sliding sideways.

## What “Coordinated” Means

A coordinated turn is when the drone’s **bank (Roll)** and **heading change (Yaw)** work together so the drone follows a smooth curve **without skidding**.

* **Roll** tilts the drone to create a turning arc.
* **Yaw** rotates the drone so the nose points through the turn.
* **Pitch** stays small and steady to maintain forward momentum (you’re not “turning with pitch,” you’re using it to keep speed).

## Yaw Awareness in a Hover (No Rolling Yet)

Before combining inputs, build control of yaw while holding position.

1. Hover a short distance above the ground.
2. **Gently apply Yaw** (Left Stick left/right) to rotate ~90°.
3. **Re-center** the stick and stabilize the hover.
4. Repeat until you can rotate **without drifting** too far.

Try rotating to face four directions (like N/E/S/W using landmarks).

## Continuous Flat Circles (Roll + Yaw)

This is your first true coordinated turn.

1. Start a slow forward flight (small Pitch forward, then re-center).
2. Begin a gentle **Roll** (Right Stick right for a right circle).
3. At the same time, apply **Yaw right** (Left Stick right) so the nose follows the circle.
4. Adjust:
   * If the drone **slides sideways** (skids), add a little more **Yaw**.
   * If the drone **spins too fast** and tightens, reduce **Yaw**.
5. Keep the circle wide and smooth for a full 360°.

Do both directions: right circles, then left circles.

## Figure-Eights (Direction Changes)

Figure-eights teach transitions and “resetting” coordination.

1. Fly a wide circle to the right using **Roll right + Yaw right**.
2. As you approach the midpoint crossover, **ease off** the right inputs.
3. Transition into a left circle with **Roll left + Yaw left**.
4. Keep speed steady with small Pitch (don’t accelerate aggressively).

Focus on making the crossover smooth and centered—not rushed.

## Common Mistakes

* **Skidding/sideways sliding:** you’re banking (Roll) but not turning the nose enough → add a touch more **Yaw**.
* **Spinning in place:** too much Yaw with not enough forward motion → reduce **Yaw** and keep a little forward speed.
* **Altitude drops in turns:** banking reduces vertical lift → add a small amount of **Throttle** during the turn.
* **Overcontrol:** holding sticks too long → use smaller inputs and re-center sooner.

## Lesson Review

* Practice **Yaw Awareness**, **Continuous Circles**, and **Figure-Eights**.
* The goal is **smooth, constant arcs**—not fast turns.
* Your turn should feel “connected”: the **nose points through** the curve instead of sliding sideways.
