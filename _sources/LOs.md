# Course Learning Objectives

This course will focus on specific learning objectives, which are key concepts required to succeed in this course. Your mastery of each learning objective will be assessed with Operational Assessments.

You will see each of these learning objectives referenced across course material by the number you see on this list. The objectives are listed in the order in which they will be covered.

| Objective | Description |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | I can properly connect my controller to Velocidrone and perform a controlled take-off, gentle hover, and landing using the four main controls in Acro mode. |
| 2 | I can achieve a stable hover, maintain a slow and gentle forward flight path, and execute controlled stopping and wide turns. |
| 3 | I can execute continuous, smooth circles and figure-eights by coordinating the Roll and Yaw controls. |
| 4 | I can fly through gates and small gaps by adjusting pitch and throttle to maintain a precise flight line. |
| 5 | I can perform a tight, 180° Hairpin Turn using aggressive Roll and Yaw combined with precise throttle management and pre-turn braking. |
| 6 | I can identify and execute advanced maneuvers like Orbits, Powerloops, and Split-S turns. |
| 7 | I can integrate advanced maneuvers into a short, technical course. |
| 8 | I can identify the main drone components, perform pre-flight inspections, follow safety protocols, and understand how simulator settings relate to real-world drone rates. |
| 9 | I can perform high-intensity time-trials under simulated stress, applying mental focus techniques to quickly recover from errors. |
| 10 | I can demonstrate all learned skills by successfully completing a Qualification Run and competing in an Elimination Race. |
